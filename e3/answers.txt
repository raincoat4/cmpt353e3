1. I think I got a better result with Kalman smoothing. Although LOESS was easier to use, it was
a lot harder to get it to detect the spikes in CPU temperature, whereas Kalman was a bit more tricky
to use, but more accurately represented the spikes.

2. Taking these parameters into account and adjusting the Kalman matrices and covariances accordingly
could have resulted in a slightly better prediction. While "time stamp" might be tricky to find value with,
data about the "course" as well as the "speed" could have been useful since it can give hints as to
what direction and what speed you are travelling.
